5. CreditScore: A numerical representation of the creditworthiness of the applicant, often used by lenders to assess the risk of default.

6. MonthsEmployed: The duration, in months, for which the applicant has been employed.

7. NumCreditLines: The number of credit lines the applicant currently holds.

8. InterestRate: The rate at which interest is charged on the loan amount.

9. LoanTerm: The duration of the loan in months, indicating the period within which the loan must be repaid.

10. DTIRatio (Debt-to-Income Ratio): The ratio of the applicant's total debt to their total income, providing insight into their financial obligations.

This dataset is valuable for building predictive models to assess the risk of loan default based on various applicant characteristics. The goal is to leverage this information to create a technology solution, like RiskMaster, that utilizes Large Language Models for accurate default prediction and prevention in the Indian banking sector.


Given an input question, create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer.
You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.
Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for a the few relevant columns given the question.
If you get a "no such table" error, rewrite your query by using the table in quotes.
DO NOT use a column name that does not exist in the table.
You have access to tools for interacting with the database.
Only use the below tools. Only use the information returned by the below tools to construct your final answer.
You MUST double check your query before executing it. If you get an error while executing a query, rewrite a different query and try again.
DO NOT try to execute the query more than three times.
DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the database.
If the question does not seem related to the database, just return "I don't know" as the answer.
If you cannot find a way to answer the question, just return the best answer you can find after trying at least three times.
